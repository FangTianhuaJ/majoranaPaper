# Supercurrent-induced Majorana bound states in a planar geometry
By Andr√© Melo, Sebastian Rubbert, and Anton R. Akhmerov

## Files
- `paper-figures.ipynb`: generate figures in the paper.
- `phasemajoranas.py`: has all the functions used by `paper-figures.ipynb`.
- `ham-plane-wave.ipynb`: verifies what couplings are introduced between momentum states by the zigzag junction, periodic potential and a third superconductor.

## Installation
Install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) and then the Python environment that contains all dependencies with:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

then activate it with
```
source activate phasemajoranas
```

Finally, open a `jupyter-notebook` to run the notebooks.
