  abstract =      {The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana
                   fermions---whose defining property is that they are
                   their own anti-particles—has since impacted diverse
                   problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark
                   matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect
                   and superconductivity. Despite this long history the
                   unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions
                   nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review
                   paper highlights recent advances in the condensed
                   matter search for Majorana that have led many in the
                   field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit.
                   We begin by introducing in some detail exotic
                   ‘topological’ one- and two-dimensional
                   superconductors that support Majorana fermions at
                   their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one
                   of the key insights that arose during the past few
                   years; namely, that it is possible to ‘engineer’
                   such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by
                   forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary
                   s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this
                   type are discussed, based on diverse materials such
                   as topological insulators, conventional
                   semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals and many others.
                   The all-important question of how one experimentally
                   detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then
                   addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements
                   that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures:
                   tunneling, Josephson effects and interferometry.
                   Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of
                   condensed matter Majorana fermions—the non-Abelian
                   exchange statistics that they generate and their
                   associated potential for quantum computation.},

  abstract =      {This is a colloquium-style introduction to the midgap
                   excitations in superconductors known as Majorana
                   fermions. These elusive particles, equal to their own
                   antiparticle, may or may not exist in Nature as
                   elementary building blocks, but in condensed matter
                   they can be constructed out of electron and hole
                   excitations. What is needed is a superconductor to
                   hide the charge difference, and a topological (Berry)
                   phase to eliminate the energy difference from
                   zero-point motion. A pair of widely separated
                   Majorana fermions, bound to magnetic or electrostatic
                   defects, has non-Abelian exchange statistics. A qubit
                   encoded in this Majorana pair is expected to have an
                   unusually long coherence time. We discuss strategies
                   to detect Majorana fermions in a topological
                   superconductor, as well as possible applications in a
                   quantum computer. The status of the experimental

                   metal cobalt (Co) on Pb(110) and check for
                   topological signatures. Using spin-polarized scanning
                   tunneling spectroscopy, we resolve ferromagnetic
                   order in the d bands of the chains. Interestingly,
                   also the subgap Yu–Shiba–Rusinov (YSR) bands
                   carry a spin polarization as was predicted decades
                   ago. Superconducting tips allow us to resolve further
                   details of the YSR bands and in particular resonances
                   at zero energy. We map the spatial distribution of
                   the zero-energy signal and find it delocalized along
                   the chain. Hence, despite the ferromagnetic coupling
                   within the chains and the strong spin-orbit coupling
                   in the superconductor, we do not find clear evidence
                   of Majorana modes. Simple tight-binding calculations
                   suggest that the spin–orbit–split bands may cross
                   the Fermi level four times which suppresses the
                   zero-energy modes.},

  abstract =      {We show that the combination of spin-orbit coupling
                   with a Zeeman field or strong interactions may lead
                   to the formation of a helical electron liquid in
                   single-channel quantum wires, with spin and velocity
                   perfectly correlated. We argue that zero-energy
                   Majorana bound states are formed in various
                   situations when such wires are situated in proximity
                   to a conventional s-wave superconductor. This occurs
                   when the external magnetic field, the superconducting
                   gap, or, most simply, the chemical potential vary
                   along the wire. These Majorana states do not require
                   the presence of a vortex in the system. Experimental
                   consequences of the helical liquid and the Majorana
                   states are also discussed.},
